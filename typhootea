Typhoo tea.

There is little that I know about tea. 

I don't know what the difference is between the brands, the leaves, the drying process. The caffien levels, the best way to brew it, the history. 

I don't know why one tastes better than another, why it leaves a stain in my mug or why it gets cold so fast.

But I do know 
That my favourite 
Is Typhoo tea.
